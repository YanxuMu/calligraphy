				<h3><b>The Origin</b></h3>
				<h4>Legend says that Cheng Miao of the Qin dynasty turned the circular and balanced form of strokes of seal script into one of regulated and angular strokes for speeding up writing, thus clerical script was born.
				The most apparent feature of the clerical script is that the beginning of horizontal lines is akin to the head of a silkworm while the finish is akin to the tail of a wild goose. Its form appears flat and square, as if the characters were gliding in the sky. In the Han dynasty, almost all official documents were written in clerical script. In the Eastern Han dynasty, steles were also mainly carved in clerical script.The emergence of the clerical script ended the era of ancient writing that has spanned nearly two thousand years, while opening a new generation for calligraphy art which looks for beautification</h4>

				<h3><b>The main features</b></h3>
				<h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Clerical Script characters are often "flat" and wider than those in Seal Script and Regular Script. Compared to Seal Script, Clerical Script gave brush freer rein, and strokes vary in width. In this script, the characteristic stroke is famously called 'silkworm head and wild goose tail' due to its distinctive shape. The structure of the official script should ensure that the font and strokes are even and the arrangement of each part is even.</li>
						<li> Distinguish the main and subordinate and echo each other: Some characters are composed of left and right or more parts. Arranging such characters requires distinguishing the main and subordinate parts of the character and forming an organic whole.</li>
						<li>Due to ancient allure and high readability, Clerical Script is widely used nowadays in crafting personal seals, advertising, designing company logos, newspaper headings, or even restaurant names (along with traditional calligraphy, naturally).</li>
