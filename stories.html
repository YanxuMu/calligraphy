		  <h3><b>The origin of the brush</b></h3>
			<h4>There is a general in Qin State called Meng Tian. One day, when Meng Tian was hunting, he saw the blood stains drawn from the wounded rabbit's tail on the ground, and he was inspired by it. He cut off the hair from the rabbit's tail, inserted it in a bamboo tube, and tried to write with it. Later, he discovered that by immersing such brushes in alkaline lime water to remove the grease on the rabbit fur, the rabbit fur would become more supple and the writing would be very smooth. According to legend, this is the origin of the brush</h4>

			<h3><b>Wang Xizhi eats ink</b></h3>
			<h4> When Wang Xizhi was a child, he devoted himself to writing. Once, he wrote attentively in the study, and even forgot to eat. His mother had to ask Shutong to deliver him the meal, with steamed buns and Wang Xizhi's favorite garlic mash. When my mother came to the study to see Xiao Xizhi, she leaned forward with a smile as soon as she entered the study. It turned out that Wang Xizhi read the copybook while eating, and dipped the ink like garlic, making his mouth black. He didn't realize it until he heard his mother laugh. </h4>

			<h4>In the Han Dynasty, there was a famous calligrapher named Zhang Zhi. His cursive writing is superb, and he is honored as "Cao Sheng" by people.According to legend, Zhang Zhi worked very hard when practicing calligraphy. He always practiced calligraphy by the pond, because it was very convenient to wash pens in the pond. Day after day, the water in the pond was washed black by him, becoming like ink. His hard work enabled him to make rapid progress in calligraphy and finally became a master of calligraphy.</h4>

Whenever he discusses his favorite calligraphy works, he can't help himself. Zhong Shaojin was a famous calligrapher at the time, and Wang Fangqing loved to communicate with him in calligraphy. According to legend, as long as Wang Fangqing fell ill, he invited Zhong Shaojing to come to his home to teach him calligraphy. As soon as Zhong Shaojin came, he was in a good mood and his condition gradually improved.</h4>

			<h3><b>The invention of rice paper</b></h3>
			<h4> According to legend, after the death of Eastern Han Dynasty papermaker Cai Lun, his apprentice Kong Dan always wanted to make a good paper for his teacher's portrait, but he never found suitable papermaking materials. One day, when he was in the valley of southern Anhui, he saw an old green sandalwood lying down in a stream. The bark had rotted and turned white, revealing slender fibers. He felt that this was a good material for papermaking, so he took it for repeated trials and finally produced a kind of paper with an excellent texture, which is the famous rice paper.</h4>
